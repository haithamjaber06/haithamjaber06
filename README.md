### 🧭 About Me

I’m currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems**, where I focus on how **software, data, and systems** work together to power modern applications.

My main goal is to grow into a **professional full stack developer**, capable of designing, building, and maintaining complete web applications — from intuitive user interfaces to reliable server-side logic and databases.

I enjoy learning by doing: turning ideas into structured, functional, and scalable digital products.

> *"Build systems that are useful, maintainable, and ready to grow."*
