### 🧭 About Me

I’m currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems**, where I explore how technology connects people, data, and design.  
I love turning creative ideas into digital experiences — whether that’s a mobile app, a fun game, or a clean, functional website.

My philosophy:  
> *"Learn, build, and share — one project at a time."*
